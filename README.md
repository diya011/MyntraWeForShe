**COMMERCE FASHION SOLUTION**
Welcome to our ecommerce fashion solution repository. This project aims to enhance the online shopping experience by addressing common issues such as lack of virtual fitting options and the need for personalized recommendations. Our solution incorporates two key features: Virtual Try-On and Personalized Wardrobe. The frontend is developed using HTML , CSS , JS and reactJS, while the backend is powered by Python's Flask frameworks and SQL queries.

Key Features:

**1. Virtual Try-On**
After the user selects a particular apparel item, they can see how the item would look on them by using our virtual try-on feature. This feature uses two modules:
Geometric Matching Module (GMM): Wraps the selected apparel around the user's uploaded image.
Try-On Module (TOM): Fits the wrapped apparel onto the user's image, providing a realistic virtual fitting experience.

**2. Personalized Wardrobe**
Our personalized wardrobe feature suggests products to users based on their previous purchases and liked products. This enhances the personalized shopping experience, providing users with tailored recommendations and helping them discover products that match their preferences.

**Tech Stack**
Frontend: HTML , CSS , JS
Backend: Flask (Python)
Database: SQLite
Machine Learning: TensorFlow
Others: OpenCV

**Usage**
Upload a Photo: Users upload a photo to begin the virtual try-on process.
Select Apparel: Users select an apparel item to try on virtually.
Virtual Try-On: Users can see how the selected apparel looks on their uploaded image.
Personalized Wardrobe: Users receive product suggestions based on their previous purchases and liked products, enhancing their shopping experience.
